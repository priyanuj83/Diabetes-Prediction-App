# ü©∫ Diabetes Prediction App

This project uses machine learning to predict whether an individual is diabetic or not based on medical diagnostic features. It is built using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset and deployed as an interactive web app using **Streamlit**.

---

## üìå Objective

To build a robust and interpretable machine learning model that can assist in the **early prediction of diabetes**, aiding healthcare professionals in screening high-risk patients more effectively.

## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis

- Replaced invalid zero values with median values in columns like `Glucose`, `BloodPressure`, etc.
- Checked for outliers using IQR method and visualized with boxplots.
- Identified class imbalance (35% positive cases).
- Generated correlation heatmap to understand feature relationships.

## üìä Model Evaluation

| Metric              | Logistic Regression | Decision Tree | Random Forest |
|---------------------|---------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Precision (Class 1) | 0.56                | 0.52           | **0.61**       |
| Recall (Class 1)    | **0.85**            | **0.85**       | 0.82           |
| F1-score (Class 1)  | 0.68                | 0.65           | **0.70**       |
| Accuracy            | 0.71                | 0.67           | **0.75**       |

**Conclusion:** Random Forest achieved the best balance between accuracy and recall for diabetic cases. It was selected for deployment.
